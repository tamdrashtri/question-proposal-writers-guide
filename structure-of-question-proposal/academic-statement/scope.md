What slices of time and space are you covering within your question? What major conceptual areas or sub-topics are you including, and which are you excluding? For example, a question about “conflict” might refer to wars between countries or fights between friends, or both and everything in between; a question about “sustainability” might refer to environmental, but not economic, aspects of a human activity, and might consider time in human terms \(e.g. decades\) or geological terms \(e.g. millions of years\). Sometimes it is easier to proceed by elimination, by identifying the things that you’re not writing about, but the final draft of this portion of your proposal should state the results of this in positive terms \(e.g. “I’m exploring X” instead of “I’m not exploring Y or Z”.
