Co-curricular activities \(if applicable\)

There’s more to your life than reading books and taking classes, and at Quest we want to encourage you to think about your life holistically: Are there things you do outside of the realm of the academic that also inform your Question? If so, you might find it worthwhile and helpful to include a short \(e.g. 1 paragraph\) discussion of how your co-curricular activities – for example, being a varsity athlete, or being part of the adventure club, or taking part in student government, or being a floor rep – inform your question. \(These things don’t necessarily have to do with your Question at all, of course; if you think that they do, though, this is an opportunity to explain how.
