A university degree implies taking courses, but what courses will you take? Your Course Plan should list two sets of courses, each in very specific ways to convey key information:

First, list the courses you have taken so far and the courses for which you are scheduled for the remainder of this academic year – this should run to 16 blocks. Identify which ones were foundation courses and list the foundation courses you still need to complete \(if any\). Includewhenyou took or will take these courses; one way to do this is to present them in a four by six table in the same way as you drafted your concentration plan during Question block.

Second, list the courses that you plan to take in the coming two years – both what courses and when. Use a four by six table as you did when drafting your Course Plan during the block. Use the draft schedules provided during Question Block; use the most current draft available, and recognize that the schedule is ever- changing: Consider identifying a few alternatives in months that have lots of courses you want to take, or list things like “elective – TBD” in months where there are still lots of empty spaces on the schedule. Identify visually \(e.g. with colour codes\) the following:

* Personal focus courses \(at least six blocks\)

* Electives \(at least three blocks\)

* Remaining foundation courses

* Experiential learning blocks \(at least one, maximum four\)

Third and finally, list your personal focus courses \(aka your major\) and give one- to-two sentence rationales for each of them. Explain why they are relevant to your question – and if you’re already taken them, e.g. in your first year, that’s ok: Just give the rationale in the past tense. If you don’t know what a course is about or want to know more than what the calendar description tells you, consult a faculty member who has taught it before or students who have taken it before to help you build your rationale!
