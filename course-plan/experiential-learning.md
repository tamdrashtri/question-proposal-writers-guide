Experiential Learning Plans

Your Question Proposal should include two different experiential learning plans. The goal with this is to develop options for experiential learning so that you can plan towards these throughout your concentration program rather than attempt to fit in a month-long placement somewhere – anywhere! – at the last minute.



An experiential learning plan has two components:

* Logistics: What would you do, where? Who would you contact to set this up, and how? Is there a formal application process \(e.g. for internship programs\) or would you have to use informal networking to generate an opportunity? When would you have to start either process?

* Academic content: What are your learning objectives with this experiential learning \(see the description page on the Portal for a good discussion of writing effective learning objectives!\) How will your faculty supervisor assess your progress against those learning objectives after your experiential learning block? What is the rationale for doing this particular thing as an experiential learning activity in relation to your question? What sort of things might you do \(or read\) to prepare for your experience? What might you do during and afterwards to create a basis for assessment \(e.g. journaling, pre/post essays, etc\)



In your Question Proposal, you should present both learning plans in summary form \(e.g. ~ 1 page each\) but make sure to include enough information so that a reader can determine why you want to do that thing, what you want to learn from it, when you might do it, and how you plan to set it up. Remember that you also need to make a case for these as part of your overall plan to explore your Question; don’t assume that your rationale is self-evident!
