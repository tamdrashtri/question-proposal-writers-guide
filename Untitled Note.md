Structure of a Question Proposal 

No two Question Proposals are going to make the argument described above in quite the same way, but every Question Proposal needs to include the following components, almost always in this order: 

* A title page (usually with cover art that expresses something about your Question)
* A statement of your question and rationale (e.g. what is it that you are asking, and why is that worth finding out about?) This statement should open with a general introduction to your question and then include two parts: 

  o An academic statement, including: 
  * ! Definitions (what do the key concepts in your question mean?)
  * ! Scope (how broad is your question? Are there instances of it that might fall within the question as written but that you’re not as interested in?)
  * ! Context (how does this question relate to what we already know in different relevant fields of knowledge? What disciplinary tools are you using to approach it, and why? What do we know and don’t we know about your Question? Are there gaps in our collective knowledge?)
  * ! Rationale (Why is this question worth studying – and not just because you care about it! Make a case for the importance of exploring your question.) 
    o A personal statement (explaining why you care about this question)
* A plan for how you will engage with your Question over the next two years at Quest University Canada
o Course Plan: What courses have you already taken? What courses will you take, when, and why? Which courses will comprise your personal focus (aka your “major”)?
 o Touchstones: What major works will you read to explore your question beyond your courses? Why these works and not others? o Experiential learning: What experiences beyond the classroom are you going to seek out, and why?
 o Co-curricular: If applicable, are there things you do in your life beyond the categories above that will contribute to your exploration of your Question?
 • Goals: A concluding statement (i.e. one-two paragraphs) that draws the text back together by stating the goals you have for yourself in exploring your question, through your plan, over the next two years. 

The following pages give more detailed descriptions, including format guidelines, for each of these sections.
