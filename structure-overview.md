The following pages describe the structure and form of a Question Proposal. They give you a map to guide your writing and thinking throughout Question Block. They are not, however, a paint-by-numbers guide: It is possible to write each of those pieces and yet not make an effective argument \(and thus not have an effective Question Proposal!\) As you go through Question Block, and particularly as you start putting the pieces of your Question Proposal together towards the end of the block, take a critical look at the argument it makes and the effectiveness of that argument.
