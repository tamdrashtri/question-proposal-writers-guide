The obvious thing that a Question Proposal does is to articulate a Question. Articulating a question is just the price of admission to a Question Proposal, although \(as you will discover over the course of Question Block\) this is itself a challenging thing to do. Your Question Plan also needs to develop an effective argument that convinces your readers of three things: i\) that your Question is worth studying, e.g. because there is a gap in our collective understanding or existing knowledge on the topic, ii\) that your Question fits into an existing body of knowledge and draws on knowledge from numerous disciplines, and iii\) you have a specific and achievable plan to pursue your chosen line of inquiry into this Question. To do each of these things requires different kinds of information, and merely having that information in your Question Proposal doesnâ€™t automatically mean that it will successfully make that argument.
