Once youâ€™ve motivated your readers to care about your Question, the next step is to provide the necessary background information to show how your Question fits into the existing knowledge from the academic disciplines that pertain to it. Remember to only include information that advances your main message \(that your chosen Question is relevant and interesting to your audience\). Make sure that each paragraph in this section has a clear topic sentence that describes to your reader show the body of the paragraph is relevant to your main message. You should consider two goals in this section. One of the major goals here is to briefly describe how your Question relates to knowledge from the numerous relevant disciplines. If done well, this will convince your audience that you have read and researched enough to be a credible person to make the argument in favor of your Question. Done badly or not at all, it will convince your audience that you are insufficiently informed about the topic to make any meaningful arguments in relation to it.
