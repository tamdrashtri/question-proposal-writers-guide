_The following is adapted from “Writing an Effective Question Plan”, by Chris Neufeld._

A Question Proposal is not just a series of short texts that explain how you will fulfill certain graduation requirements: It is an argument whose purpose is to convince the reader of the validity of your Question, the utility of spending two years exploring it, and the viability of your plan for doing so. Obviously that argument cannot proceed without a clearly articulated Question, but merely having that Question doesn’t automatically produce an effective argument. Nor does merely having all of the sections of a Question Proposal described elsewhere in this document!

It is important to keep in mind, though, that an effective Question Proposal makes the rhetorical moves to build this argument _through_ the components of the text listed in later pages. In other words, you need to accomplish several tasks with your text – but this doesn’t mean that you will simply add additional subheadings for each task! Think about what your text is _doing_ in terms of building an argument as well as what information it is conveying.
