Towards the end of Question Block, you will give a 12-minute presentation of your Question Proposal to your peers, the Quest community, and the broader public. This oral presentation is your first opportunity to put all the pieces together and articulate the overall argument of your Question Proposal, and to do so in a way that offers a space for others to ask you questions and give you feedback and new ideas. Remember that your presentation needs to make the argument described on page 2-4, and manage your time accordingly – don’t just give six minutes to the question statement and six minutes to your plan.

We suggest the following format guidelines for your presentation, particularly if you are going to use a visual aide like PowerPoint:

* 12 minutes \(+3 for questions\); suggested ~12-15 slides

* See-hear-read congruity \(i.e. make your message consistent across the

  visual and oral components of your presentation\)

* Comprehensible to a visual/hearing impaired audience

* Informative title slide \(suggestion: your Question in written or diagrammatic or image form\)

* Background one colour throughout

* Text one colour throughout \(up to one additional colour for emphasis\)

* Max 2 fonts \(used consistently\); sufficiently large – check from back of room

* ≤10 words per slide

* No bulleted lists

* Relevant and informative images used effectively

* Important facts, data, quotations, images all cited in the slide where they appear

* Informative concluding slide \(suggestion: your Question in written diagrammatic or image form\)

* No sunsets or “any questions” or references slides

  Presentations must be copied to the presentation laptop in the library the night before you give your talk. The talks will be ordered and opened before the sessions begin each day, and will no longer be available for revision. Take the time the night before to check that your presentation runs smoothly on that particular laptop
