The Question Proposal

_A Writer’s Guide_

Your Question Proposal is the key deliverable for the Question Block; it is the text that you will take to your mentor to refine into a plan for your next two years at Quest. It is made up of several components, and over the course of the block you will work on each one several times. This writer’s guide explains two things: First, what a Question Proposal is supposed to _do_ (from a rhetorical perspective), and second what a Question Proposal should _be_ (from a structural perspective, e.g. what things need to be in the text.) During Question Block you will present your Question Proposal both as a written text and as an oral presentation; the format guidelines vary with the medium but the core of the proposal – the argument it makes and the things it contains – is the same in both.

The Question Proposal as Argument

_The following is adapted from “Writing an Effective Question Plan”, by Chris Neufeld._

A Question Proposal is not just a series of short texts that explain how you will fulfill certain graduation requirements: It is an argument whose purpose is to convince the reader of the validity of your Question, the utility of spending two years exploring it, and the viability of your plan for doing so. Obviously that argument cannot proceed without a clearly articulated Question, but merely having that Question doesn’t automatically produce an effective argument. Nor does merely having all of the sections of a Question Proposal described elsewhere in this document!

It is important to keep in mind, though, that an effective Question Proposal makes the rhetorical moves to build this argument _through_ the components of the text listed in later pages. In other words, you need to accomplish several tasks with your text – but this doesn’t mean that you will simply add additional subheadings for each task! Think about what your text is _doing_ in terms of building an argument as well as what information it is conveying.

Who is your audience?

When writing your Question Proposal, imagining your audience can be difficult. Are you writing to your Mentor, your friends, your parents, your future employers? Arguably, all these people (and many others) are going to ask you about your Question over the next few years, so being able to discuss your Question with a diverse audience in an engaging way will be immensely valuable. Given the varied interests of this broad potential audience, you might want think about writing to an informed general public (that encompasses all these people) when choosing your tone. If you’re unsure, simply imagine each one of these people and try to think about what might motivate them to care about your Question. Or better yet, ask them!

What does a good Question Proposal do?

The obvious thing that a Question Proposal does is to articulate a Question. Articulating a question is just the price of admission to a Question Proposal, although (as you will discover over the course of Question Block) this is itself a challenging thing to do. Your Question Plan also needs to develop an effective argument that convinces your readers of three things: i) that your Question is worth studying, e.g. because there is a gap in our collective understanding or existing knowledge on the topic, ii) that your Question fits into an existing body of knowledge and draws on knowledge from numerous disciplines, and iii) you have a specific and achievable plan to pursue your chosen line of inquiry into this Question. To do each of these things requires different kinds of information, and merely having that information in your Question Proposal doesn’t automatically mean that it will successfully make that argument.

**_i) Your Question is worth studying_**

It is easy to explain why _you_ are interested in your Question; it is much harder to explain to a skeptical reader why _they_ should be interested in your Question. The traditional way to approach doing this is to convince your audience that there is a gap in our collective knowledge, or perhaps in your individual knowledge, that is worth spending two years trying to fill in. You might also argue that there is a gap between what is known and what is practiced, or that the Question you are exploring is an enduring feature of human existence. The point is to build a credible argument that will convince somebody _else_ that it is worth doing.

To convince your audience of this, you must do two things:

First, establish _common ground_ with your audience by stating a pertinent observation/fact that your audience will accept. In the case of your QP, a good statement of common ground might take the form of a sentence or two about the topic at the centre of your Question that sums up the pertinent aspects of what your audience likely knows about the subject. This might be one of the first things you do, right up front when you introduce the Question itself; you can then return to that theme after you’ve built up your credibility by showing what is already known (and not known) about this Question.

Second, briefly describe the rationale in terms of what we do and do not yet know about your topic, and why we should. A rationale may be defined at each of two levels: the benefits of this line of inquiry to your own academic growth, and the benefits to society at large. The benefits to you may simply be phrased as a lack of knowledge (i.e that you don’t know and why you want to learn). However, an excellent Question also has possible benefits to society. In other words, in addition to helping you learn, what other benefits can you think of for asking this unique question? It is worth thinking carefully about this second level of justification to lend your Question more validity with members of your audience that do not know you personally and may not have anything invested in your academic growth. Also, don’t confuse your personal motivations for choosing this Question (e.g. you have a Question about dolphins because you liked dolphins as a child) with the academic benefits to you of exploring it (e.g. you wish to gain a deeper knowledge of the behaviour of marine mammals as a stepping stone to further work, either professional or academic, in marine conservation.)

1.  **_The Question fits into an existing body of knowledge and draws on knowledge from numerous disciplines_**

Once you’ve motivated your readers to care about _your_ Question, the next step is to provide the necessary background information to show how your Question fits into the existing knowledge from the academic disciplines that pertain to it.

Remember to only include information that advances your main message (that your chosen Question is relevant and interesting to your audience). Make sure that each paragraph in this section has a clear topic sentence that describes to your readers _how_ the body of the paragraph is relevant to your main message. You should consider two goals in this section. One of the major goals here is to briefly describe how your Question relates to knowledge from the numerous

3

relevant disciplines. If done well, this will convince your audience that you have read and researched enough to be a credible person to make the argument in favor of your Question. Done badly or not at all, it will convince your audience that you are insufficiently informed about the topic to make any meaningful arguments in relation to it.

1.  **_You have a specific and achievable plan to pursue your chosen line of inquiry_**

This is where you describe what specifically you are going to do to inquire into this interesting and relevant Question. This section begins with a paragraph or two about your overall plan. For example, you might want to explore some ideas by taking classes or reading seminal literature in the field by including certain specific books in your touchstones, while other areas you may want to gain specific skills or experiences better served through an Experiential Learning, a Quest Summer Fellowship, or through a particular Keystone project that you might already have in mind. How have you chosen to divide up your lines of inquiry between courses, touchstones, experiential learning? Why this way and not some other way? Your goal here is to convince your reader that the way you have chosen to spend your time is valuable, appropriate, and achievable.

Your introductory paragraph is then followed with subsections (often in point form and/or in tables) that outlines exactly which books you’ll be reading, which courses you’ll be taking, and a brief rationale for each one that conveys to your audience that you know what each course is about, and can justify how each one relates to your Question.

Linking argument and structure

The following pages describe the structure and form of a Question Proposal. They give you a map to guide your writing and thinking throughout Question Block. They are not, however, a paint-by-numbers guide: It is possible to write each of those pieces and yet not make an effective argument (and thus not have an effective Question Proposal!) As you go through Question Block, and particularly as you start putting the pieces of your Question Proposal together towards the end of the block, take a critical look at the argument it makes and the effectiveness of that argument.

Structure of a Question Proposal

No two Question Proposals are going to make the argument described above in quite the same way, but _every_ Question Proposal needs to include the following components, almost always in this order:

*   A title page (usually with cover art that expresses something about your Question)
*   A statement of your question and rationale (e.g. what is it that you are asking, and why is that worth finding out about?) This statement should open with a general introduction to your question and then include two parts:

o An academic statement, including:

*   *   Definitions (what do the key concepts in your question mean?)
    *   Scope (how broad is your question? Are there instances of it that might fall within the question as written but that you’re not as interested in?)
    *   Context (how does this question relate to what we already know in different relevant fields of knowledge? What disciplinary tools are you using to approach it, and why? What do we know and don’t we know about your Question? Are there gaps in our collective knowledge?)
    *   Rationale (Why is this question worth studying – and not just because _you_ care about it! Make a case for the

importance of exploring your question.)

*   1.  A personal statement (explaining why _you_ care about this question)
*   A plan for how you will engage with your Question over the next two years at Quest University Canada
    1.  Course Plan: What courses have you already taken? What courses

will you take, when, and why? Which courses will comprise your personal focus (aka your “major”)?

1.  Touchstones: What major works will you read to explore your question beyond your courses? Why these works and not others?
2.  Experiential learning: What experiences beyond the classroom are you going to seek out, and why?
    1.  Co-curricular: If applicable, are there things you do in your life beyond the categories above that will contribute to your exploration of your Question?

*   Goals: A concluding statement (i.e. one-two paragraphs) that draws the text back together by stating the goals you have for yourself in exploring your question, through your plan, over the next two years.

The following pages give more detailed descriptions, including format guidelines, for each of these sections.

Title page

This is just what it says – a title page. The point of having a title page is to present some information about your text that will help you and other people situate it in time and space afterwards, and also to give you an opportunity to present an image that may be representative of your question in some way.

Your title page should include:

1.  An image that represents your question (Image must either be an original work created by you, or an existing work that you cite appropriately)
2.  Your Question (≤10 words)
3.  Your name
4.  Current Faculty Advisor
5.  Proposed Faculty Mentor
6.  Question Instructor and Block (e.g. December 2014)

Question Statement

Your Question Statement is where you make the first two rhetorical moves described on pages 2-4: First, you assert that your question is both worth studying, e.g. you develop both an academic rationale (why other people should care) and explain a personal motive (why you care); second, you connect that question to existing bodies of knowledge by showing what we do (and don’t) already know about it. You make those rhetorical moves by advancing through an academic statement _of_ your question and a personal statement _about_ your question. Naturally, full referencing is required throughout your text in an accepted academic citation style.

The opening of your Question Proposal is like the opening of any other text that makes an argument: You need to establish common ground with your audience and lay out the argument you are going to make. Try not to be pedantic about it, but if in doubt it is better to be clunky and obvious about your argument than to assume it is self-evident (because it probably isn’t!) First worry about expressing the argument; then worry about expressing it elegantly.

Academic Statement

A concise, precise, objective, academic statement of why this question is interesting and worthy of study, with reference to current and historic literature on the topic. Since this requires you to be able to make statements about scholarship and cite evidence for those statements, writing a good academic statement will require you to have done fairly extensive reviews of the scholarly literature relevant to your Question in different disciplines. That’s just the price of admission, though: Your Academic Statement needs to be a coherent text that provides the following information (and organizes it using subheadings):

1.  Definitions. What you do mean by each of the key words used in your question? Don’t just make definitions up: How are these concepts defined in existing scholarship? Do different disciplines define the same concept differently? Is a concept particularly hard to define such

6

that you need to take inspiration from other thinkers and carefully and deliberately build your own definition?

1.  Scope. What slices of time and space are you covering within your question? What major conceptual areas or sub-topics are you including, and which are you excluding? For example, a question about “conflict” might refer to wars between countries or fights between friends, or both and everything in between; a question about “sustainability” might refer to environmental, but not economic, aspects of a human activity, and might consider time in human terms (e.g. decades) or geological terms (e.g. millions of years). Sometimes it is easier to proceed by elimination, by identifying the things that you’re _not_ writing about, but the final draft of this portion of your proposalshould state the results of this in positive terms (e.g. “I’m exploring X” instead of “I’m not exploring Y or Z”.)
2.  Context. What is the essential academic background to understanding this academic and intellectual area of study? What different academic disciplines engage with this question in some way (try to identify at least three)? How do these disciplines differ in the way that they explore the question, and what do they know about it? What are the things that scholars know that they don’t know? Who are some of the major thinkers who have considered this question before, and what did they say about it? You should never reinvent the wheel; depending on what your question is and what disciplines you are exploring, you may discover answers upon which to build your own understanding, or you may discover ever-more sophisticated ways of posing the same question! Regardless, you are trying to establish credibility with your reader by showing that you are aware of existing knowledge and are able to use it effectively to build your own understanding.
3.  Rationale. Why is this an academically interesting question? Why is it important to spend time on it? What insights would the answer provide? What insights will studying it – even if you don’t answer it – provide? You might establish a rationale by showing that there’s a gap in our knowledge that your Question would answer, or you might do this by showing the “real-world” stakes of answering the question in a way that translates knowledge into practice, or you might show how the question is a timeless aspect of human existence whose examination and re-examination generates insights into the human experience. Regardless of the specific strategy you use, your rationale should do two things: First, it should return to the common ground you established at the beginning of your Question Proposal, and second, it should make it clear to the reader why _they_ should care about your Question and why it is worth exploring.

Personal Statement

Why are _you_ interested in your question? You might consider (1) your relevant background (e.g., family background, personal, educational, or employment

7

experience, inspiring people or works you have encountered, spirituality, etc.), (2) your values (if so, where do these come from?), or (3) your personal goals in devoting two years of thought to the topic. Your personal statement, as well as your academic statement, will inform the goals that you identify in the closing of your Question Proposal – so it is worth spending some time developing those here.

This should be short – no more than one page! – but it will probably take a lot of thought to write well. During the Question Block, you will be asked to write a Foundation Reflection essay as a precursor to a personal statement; this is because experience has shown that systematic reflection about your past two years at Quest greatly helps avoid the problem of a superficial or self-evident personal statement. It can also help you refine your Question, particularly if you’re not quite sure yet what it is – and even if you think you are sure!

The Plan: Your Concentration Program

Once you’ve articulated your Question and asserted a rationale for exploring it, you need to convince your reader that you’ve got a meaningful and appropriate plan for doing so at Quest over the next two years. We call this your Concentration Program; unlike the Foundation Program, which we define for you, you define this for yourself. In this section, you don’t just list courses you want to take, or things you want to read, or experiences you want to have; you need to further develop your overall argument by explaining how these relate to your Question and showing how they will help you explore it.

Course Plan

A university degree implies taking courses, but what courses will you take? Your Course Plan should list two sets of courses, each in very specific ways to convey key information:

First, list the courses you have taken so far and the courses for which you are scheduled for the remainder of this academic year – this should run to 16 blocks. Identify which ones were foundation courses and list the foundation courses you still need to complete (if any). Include _when_ you took or will take these courses; one way to do this is to present them in a four by six table in the same way as you drafted your concentration plan during Question block.

Second, list the courses that you plan to take in the coming two years – both what courses and when. Use a four by six table as you did when drafting your Course Plan during the block. Use the draft schedules provided during Question Block; use the most current draft available, and recognize that the schedule is ever-changing: Consider identifying a few alternatives in months that have lots of courses you want to take, or list things like “elective – TBD” in months where there are still lots of empty spaces on the schedule. Identify visually (e.g. with colour codes) the following:

*   Personal focus courses (at least six blocks)
*   Electives (at least three blocks)
*   Remaining foundation courses

8

*   Experiential learning blocks (at least one, maximum four)

Third and finally, list your personal focus courses (aka your major) and give one-to-two sentence rationales for each of them. Explain why they are relevant to your question – and if you’re already taken them, e.g. in your first year, that’s ok: Just give the rationale in the past tense. If you don’t know what a course is about or want to know more than what the calendar description tells you, consult a faculty member who has taught it before or students who have taken it before to help you build your rationale!

Touchstone Readings

Beyond the readings you will do for your courses, you should also identify – working jointly with your faculty mentor, other faculty members, and other members of the university community – five touchstone works. These are the key texts (or other sources) that a scholar in the field(s) of your Question would expect you to have read and to be able to discuss. They may include historic and modern works. They may include books, as well as a selection of articles academic journals (though generally of book length or equivalent), or relevant films, plays, or art pieces. They are unlikely to include textbooks, which are excellent reference sources but generally are not recommended as touchstones. If you find you have more than 5 sources, try sorting them into an A list and a B list.

Provide a one-sentence rationale for each touchstone reading that locates it within the larger scholarly context, and explains how it is relevant to your Question. Make sure that you give full bibliographic details for each touchstone reading.

Experiential Learning Plans

Your Question Proposal should include two different experiential learning plans. The goal with this is to develop options for experiential learning so that you can plan towards these throughout your concentration program rather than attempt to fit in a month-long placement somewhere – anywhere! – at the last minute.

An experiential learning plan has two components:

*   Logistics: What would you do, where? Who would you contact to set this up, and how? Is there a formal application process (e.g. for internship programs) or would you have to use informal networking to generate an opportunity? When would you have to start either process?
*   Academic content: What are your learning objectives with this experiential learning (see the description page on the Portal for a good discussion of writing effective learning objectives!) How will your faculty supervisor assess your progress against those learning objectives after your experiential learning block? What is the rationale for doing this particular thing as an experiential learning activity in relation to your question? What sort of things might you do (or read) to prepare for your experience? What might you do during and afterwards to create a basis for assessment (e.g. journaling, pre/post essays, etc)?

9

In your Question Proposal, you should present both learning plans in summary form (e.g. ~ 1 page each) but make sure to include enough information so that a reader can determine why you want to do that thing, what you want to learn from it, when you might do it, and how you plan to set it up. Remember that you also need to make a case for these as part of your overall plan to explore your Question; don’t assume that your rationale is self-evident!

Co-curricular activities (if applicable)

There’s more to your life than reading books and taking classes, and at Quest we want to encourage you to think about your life holistically: Are there things you do outside of the realm of the academic that also inform your Question? If so, you might find it worthwhile and helpful to include a short (e.g. 1 paragraph) discussion of how your co-curricular activities – for example, being a varsity athlete, or being part of the adventure club, or taking part in student government, or being a floor rep – inform your question. (These things don’t necessarily have to do with your Question at all, of course; if you think that they do, though, this is an opportunity to explain how.)

Goals

Your Question Proposal should close by returning to the initial common ground and motive that you laid out at the beginning, as well as the rationale (both academic and personal) that you advanced in the text. What goals do you have for yourself in the pursuit of your plan over the next two years? A Question Proposal doesn’t necessarily have a ‘conclusion’ in the traditional sense, but you still need to draw the text to a close in a way that restates your essential argument: That you have a question; that it is worth studying (in general as well as personally); that it connects with existing knowledge; and that you have a plan for exploring it. Recapping this while identifying some goals helps keep the Question Proposal a forward-looking text.

The Question Presentation: Same thing, different medium

Towards the end of Question Block, you will give a 12-minute presentation of your Question Proposal to your peers, the Quest community, and the broader public. This oral presentation is your first opportunity to put all the pieces together and articulate the overall argument of your Question Proposal, and to do so in a way that offers a space for others to ask you questions and give you feedback and new ideas. Remember that your presentation needs to make the argument described on page 2-4, and manage your time accordingly – don’t just give six minutes to the question statement and six minutes to your plan.

We suggest the following format guidelines for your presentation, particularly if you are going to use a visual aide like PowerPoint:

*   12 minutes (+3 for questions); suggested ~12-15 slides
*   See-hear-read congruity (i.e. make your message consistent across the visual and oral components of your presentation)
*   Comprehensible to a visual/hearing impaired audience

10

*   Informative title slide (suggestion: your Question in written or diagrammatic or image form)
*   Background one colour throughout
*   Text one colour throughout (up to one additional colour for emphasis)
*   Max 2 fonts (used consistently); sufficiently large – check from back of room
*   ≤10 words per slide
*   No bulleted lists
*   Relevant and informative images used effectively
*   Important facts, data, quotations, images all cited in the slide where they appear
*   Informative concluding slide (suggestion: your Question in written or diagrammatic or image form)
*   No sunsets or “any questions” or references slides

Presentations must be copied to the presentation laptop in the library _the night_ _before you give your talk_. The talks will be ordered and opened before the sessionsbegin each day, and will no longer be available for revision. Take the time _the_ _night before_ to check that your presentation runs smoothly on that particularlaptop.
