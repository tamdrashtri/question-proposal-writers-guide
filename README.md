The Question Proposal - A Writer’s Guide

Your Question Proposal is the key deliverable for the Question Block; it is the text that you will take to your mentor to refine into a plan for your next two years at Quest. It is made up of several components, and over the course of the block you will work on each one several times. This writer’s guide explains two things: First, what a Question Proposal is supposed todo\(from a rhetorical perspective\), and second what a Question Proposal shouldbe\(from a structural perspective, e.g. what things need to be in the text.\) During Question Block you will present your Question Proposal both as a written text and as an oral presentation; the format guidelines vary with the medium but the core of the proposal – the argument it makes and the things it contains – is the same in both.
