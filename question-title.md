Question Statement

Your Question Statement is where you make the first two rhetorical moves described on pages 2-4: First, you assert that your question is both worth studying, e.g. you develop both an academic rationale \(why other people should care\) and explain a personal motive \(why you care\); second, you connect that question to existing bodies of knowledge by showing what we do \(and don’t\) already know about it. You make those rhetorical moves by advancing through an academic statementofyour question and a personal statementaboutyour question. Naturally, full referencing is required throughout your text in an accepted academic citation style.

The opening of your Question Proposal is like the opening of any other text that makes an argument: You need to establish common ground with your audience and lay out the argument you are going to make. Try not to be pedantic about it, but if in doubt it is better to be clunky and obvious about your argument than to assume it is self-evident \(because it probably isn’t!\) First worry about expressing the argument; then worry about expressing it elegantly
