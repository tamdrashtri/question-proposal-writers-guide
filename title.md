Title page

This is just what it says – a title page. The point of having a title page is to present some information about your text that will help you and other people situate it in time and space afterwards, and also to give you an opportunity to present an image that may be representative of your question in some way.

Your title page should include:

1. An image that represents your question \(Image must either be an original work created by you, or an existing work that you cite appropriately\)

2. Your Question \(≤10 words\)

3. Your name

4. Current Faculty Advisor

5. Proposed Faculty Mentor

6. Question Instructor and Block \(e.g. December 2014\)
