When writing your Question Proposal, imagining your audience can be difficult. Are you writing to your Mentor, your friends, your parents, your future employers? Arguably, all these people \(and many others\) are going to ask you about your Question over the next few years, so being able to discuss your Question with a diverse audience in an engaging way will be immensely valuable. Given the varied interests of this broad potential audience, you might want think about writing to an informed general public \(that encompasses all these people\) when choosing your tone. If youâ€™re unsure, simply imagine each one of these people and try to think about what might motivate them to care about your Question. Or better yet, ask them!
