Goals

Your Question Proposal should close by returning to the initial common ground and motive that you laid out at the beginning, as well as the rationale \(both academic and personal\) that you advanced in the text. What goals do you have for yourself in the pursuit of your plan over the next two years? A Question Proposal doesn’t necessarily have a ‘conclusion’ in the traditional sense, but you still need to draw the text to a close in a way that restates your essential argument: That you have a question; that it is worth studying \(in general as well as personally\); that it connects with existing knowledge; and that you have a plan for exploring it. Recapping this while identifying some goals helps keep the Question Proposal a forward-looking text.
